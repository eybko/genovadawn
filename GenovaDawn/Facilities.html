<h1>Facilities</h1>
<p>Genova Dawn is located on 100 acres of land with numerous trails for trail riding, pleasure riding, or eventing runs. We have three lakes and two ponds, all with fountains to keep the water from becoming stagnant. Along one of our many trails runs a creek that both riders and horses are encouraged to explore. Our main barn includes and indoor arena with a viewing area for those looking to buy horses. 
<p>The main and secondary barn include showers and changing rooms for riders. They also have two tacks rooms each that are heated and cooled to maintain the quality of our clients belongings. For horses there are wash stalls and tacking areas around the barn. We value our horses greatly, therefore we also have a water treamdmill and heater available pre and post exercise for them.</p>
<p>Included in our facilities is an outdoor arena, dressage arena, and field jumps for our eventers. We believe that a good equestrian is a well rounded one, and our facilities reflect that. As for our riders, we also offer lounge areas for those hot summer days and cold winter mornings. Included are complimentary fans, cooling towels, heating blankets, and a drink fountain. We also offer hot beverages and a variety of different teas and coffees.</p>
